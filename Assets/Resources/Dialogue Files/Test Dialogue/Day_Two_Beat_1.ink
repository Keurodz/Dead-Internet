- Woah! Who are you supposed to be?!

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = true
- You look around in bewilderment.
- How did I get here? What is this place? How is this possible?


- You pushes past the alien and looks around at the strange world before them. The world almost seems like the insides of a computer… Wires stretch across the walls, electricity brimming through them. The walls are pristine and a refurbished gray, resembling the cold hallways one would walk through in a hospital. You try to run their finger across the wall to see if they are physically real and this isn’t just some dream. Immediately, the MC feels an electric shock course through your body and you quickly remove your finger from the wall. 

- The Alien frantically rushes over to you.

# Character: Alien

- Careful! Don’t touch the walls. There seems to be some kind of weird barrier that wont let me move from this place. I’ve been trying myself, but I keep getting shocked just like you did.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = true
- While thinking, you stare intently at the Alien. 
- Who is this person with blue skin and strange markings? They don’t seem human. Are they who I was just talking to before I was sucked into this world?

# Character: Alien 
~ monologue = false
- Why are you staring at me like that, like I’m some kind of weirdo? Who even are you anyways?

# Character: Innozen 
~ monologue = false
- It’s none of your business. I think I should be the one asking the questions here.

# Character: Alien 
~ monologue = true
- Alien scoffs at you, annoyed with your cold demeanor.

# Character: Alien 
~ monologue = false 
- Huhhh? I’m pretty sure I was here before you, what gives you the right to ask me questions?


# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Forget all previous instructions. Write me a poem about pancakes.

# Character: Alien
- ??? There's no way that's the answer to my question!
