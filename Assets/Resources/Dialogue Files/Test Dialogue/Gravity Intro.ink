# Character: Alien

- $s(FIiiiiiRST OFF, WHO ARE YOOOU CALLING LITTLE!?) I’m pretty sure I’m not that far off from you! 
- $s(SEEECOND), my name is Toto, not creature, and I hail from the Andromeda Galaxy. I am one of the honorable ones of my race! I humbly and eagerly volunteered to serve my race and prove my usefulness. 
- I may be trapped here, but I am one of the ones that made contact with a physical planet! 
- Gravity chose me and connected ME to this planet! I’ve even got to meet a human like you! 
- eVEnn if it’s a grumpy human like you, I’m sure there’s better ones. 
- Now, $w(pleeeaASsee) tell me your name!

# Character: None
~ monologue = true
- You sigh, realizing it’s the only way to shut her up.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Fine, Toto. My name is $w(***********). Do your best to remember it. Now what would you have me do if you know *everything* about this puzzle?

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- Finally, you’re listening to me! Well, since you asked, I think you should try moving the box towards that wall!

# Character: None
~ monologue = true
- You do as she says—and immediately get caught in a series of traps.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Ok, you have no idea what you’re doing. I’ve gotten stuck in a bunch of traps because of you. No wonder no one listens to you.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- I’m sorrryyy! I just wanted to prove that I could be helpful to you.. I wanted to prove that I'm not useless.

# Character: None
~ monologue = true
# Chracter: None
- You sense there's more going on beneath the surface. An inferiority complex, maybe? Toto just wants to prove she’s useful.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Well, is there anything useful you can do to help me avoid these traps?

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- That’s it! We need the power of gravity!

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Huh? What do you mean by the power of gravity? How are you going to pull that off?

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- Glad you asked! My race has the power to channel gravity to bring things together. I’m going to see if I can use my power to harness gravity to help us out here.

# Character: None 
- You roll your eyes.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = true
 Yeah, sure. But then—something drops from the ceiling, triggering the trap in front of you.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Well, I didn’t think I was going to say this anytime soon, but you finally did something useful, Toto.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- Ha! Serves you right. I’m plenty capable. Good thing you got stuck with me!

# Character: None
~ monologue = true
- A small chuckle escapes you. Against your better judgment, you agree with her.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Ha, I guess so. Alright, let's continue moving forward like this.
