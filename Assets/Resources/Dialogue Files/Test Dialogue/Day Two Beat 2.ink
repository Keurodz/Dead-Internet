 ~PLAY_MUSIC("Shocked")
~ monologue = false
# Character: None
~ monologue = true
- You try to hold the alien back, but they’re too fast and gone in a blink. Not wanting to be left behind, you rush after them.

- You arrive in a room with high walls and obstacles. It almost resembles a maze.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- What is happening?

# Character: None
~ monologue = true
- A disembodied voice echoes in your mind. You flinch in surprise.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- WHAT? Where are you? Why does it sound like you're in my head?

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- I don’t know, but why did you follow me?

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- . . . 

# Character: Automatic Voice
~ monologue = false
- Welcome, Toto, to the maze specially designed for you.

 ~PLAY_MUSIC("Horror")
~ monologue = true
- A loud whirring noise fills the room. A bulky mechanical claw appears, grabbing Toto, who flails in protest.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- Ahhhh! Where did this thing come from!? Put me down right now or I swear!!!

~ monologue = true
- Despite struggling, Toto can’t escape. She goes limp and is soon placed in a cage high above you. She scrambles to the bars, pleading—more like threatening—you for help.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- Hey you! Down there! You better help me right now! Why aren’t you doing anything!!?

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- I think you have only yourself to blame for getting trapped in there. I’m also not really obligated to help you; you’re just some weird creature to me. I’m more concerned about how I’m getting out of here.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- CMonnn, Pleaseeeee, don’t be like that!

~ monologue = true
- You ignore her. The same terminal from before rises before you. Words flash across the screen—some kind of instructions.

 ~PLAY_MUSIC("Puzzle")
# Character: Automatic Voice
~ monologue = false
- Please move the crates containing data to their designated spot, highlighted in pink, to send them out into the network.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = true
- Network? Data crates? It’s almost like we’re inside a computer… Am I inside my computer? How can any of this make sense? Then again, AI might just replace humans someday. I don’t think I have any choice but to go along with this farce.

# Character: None
- You begin analyzing the maze and how to move the blocks. Meanwhile, Toto won’t shut up.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- I think you should move it that way! And then that way! That will totally work. Come on! Trust me! I’m very capable. Just try things for me, okkk?

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Trust? There’s no one I can trust right now.

- Little creature, who are you to tell me what to do? Obviously you don’t know what you’re doing, otherwise you wouldn't be stuck up there now. Just let me do my thing.
