~ monologue = false
# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = true
- You try to hold the alien back, but they’re too fast and gone in a blink. Not wanting to be left behind, you rush after them.

- You arrive in a room with high walls and obstacles. It almost resembles a maze.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- What is happening?

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = true
- A disembodied voice echoes in your mind. You flinch in surprise.
- WHAT? Where are you? Why does it sound like you're in my head?

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- I don’t know, but why did you follow me?

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- …

# Character: Automatic Voice
~ monologue = false
- Welcome, Toto, to the maze specially designed for you.

 ~PLAY_MUSIC("Horror")
~ monologue = true
- A loud whirring noise fills the room. A bulky mechanical claw appears, grabbing Toto, who flails in protest.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- Ahhhh! Where did this thing come from!? Put me down right now or I swear!!!

~ monologue = true
- Despite struggling, Toto can’t escape. She goes limp and is soon placed in a cage high above you. She scrambles to the bars, pleading—more like threatening—you for help.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- Hey you! Down there! You better help me right now! Why aren’t you doing anything!!?

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- I think you have only yourself to blame for getting trapped in there. I’m also not really obligated to help you; you’re just some weird creature to me. I’m more concerned about how I’m getting out of here.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- CMonnn, Pleaseeeee, don’t be like that!

~ monologue = true
- You ignore her. The same terminal from before rises before you. Words flash across the screen—some kind of instructions.

 ~PLAY_MUSIC("Puzzle")
# Character: Automatic Voice
~ monologue = false
- Please move the crates containing data to their designated spot, highlighted in pink, to send them out into the network.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = true
- Network? Data crates? It’s almost like we’re inside a computer… Am I inside my computer? How can any of this make sense? Then again, AI might just replace humans someday. I don’t think I have any choice but to go along with this farce.

- You begin analyzing the maze and how to move the blocks. Meanwhile, Toto won’t shut up.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- I think you should move it that way! And then that way! That will totally work. Come on! Trust me! I’m very capable. Just try things for me, okkk?

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Trust? There’s no one I can trust right now.

- Little creature, who are you to tell me what to do? Obviously you don’t know what you’re doing, otherwise you wouldn't be stuck up there now. Just let me do my thing.

 ~PLAY_MUSIC("Alien")
# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- $s(FIiiiiiRST OFF, WHO ARE YOOOU CALLING LITTLE!?) I’m pretty sure I’m not that far off from you! 
- $s(SEEECOND), my name is Toto, not creature, and I hail from the Andromeda Galaxy. I am one of the honorable ones of my race! I humbly and eagerly volunteered to serve my race and prove my usefulness. 
- I may be trapped here, but I am one of the ones that made contact with a physical planet! 
- Gravity chose me and connected ME to this planet! I’ve even got to meet a human like you! 
- eVEnn if it’s a grumpy human like you, I’m sure there’s better ones. 
- Now, $w(pleeeaASsee) tell me your name!

# Character: None
~ monologue = true
- You sigh, realizing it’s the only way to shut her up.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Fine, Toto. My name is $w(***********). Do your best to remember it. Now what would you have me do if you know *everything* about this puzzle?

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- Finally, you’re listening to me! Well, since you asked, I think you should try moving the box towards that wall!

# Character: None
~ monologue = true
- You do as she says—and immediately get caught in a series of traps.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Ok, you have no idea what you’re doing. I’ve gotten stuck in a bunch of traps because of you. No wonder no one listens to you.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- I’m sorrryyy! I just wanted to prove that I could be helpful to you.. I wanted to prove that I'm not useless.

# Character: None
~ monologue = true
# Chracter: None
- You sense there's more going on beneath the surface. An inferiority complex, maybe? Toto just wants to prove she’s useful.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Well, is there anything useful you can do to help me avoid these traps?

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- That’s it! We need the power of gravity!

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Huh? What do you mean by the power of gravity? How are you going to pull that off?

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- Glad you asked! My race has the power to channel gravity to bring things together. I’m going to see if I can use my power to harness gravity to help us out here.

# Character: None 
- You roll your eyes.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = true
 Yeah, sure. But then—something drops from the ceiling, triggering the trap in front of you.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Well, I didn’t think I was going to say this anytime soon, but you finally did something useful, Toto.

# Character: Alien
~ monologue = false
- Ha! Serves you right. I’m plenty capable. Good thing you got stuck with me!

# Character: None
~ monologue = true
- A small chuckle escapes you. Against your better judgment, you agree with her.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Ha, I guess so. Alright, let's continue moving forward like this.
