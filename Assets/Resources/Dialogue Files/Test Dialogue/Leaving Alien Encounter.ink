- Oh! It looks like you are in the final control room. 

# Character: Innozen 
~ monologue = false
- Huh? How do you know where I am?

# Character: Toto
~ monologue = false
- I have this display of the layout for this world. Kind of like a map and I have been monitoring your movements.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Wait, why didn't you tell me this earlier? It would have been much easier to figure out how to get around this place.

# Character: Toto
~ monologue = false
- Yeah but honestly I cannot interpret what any of it really means. It is just 1s and 0s, I only see faint shapes.
- Besides, it was pretty fun to see how you behaved. $w(Are all humans like this?)

# Character: Innozen 
~ monologue = false
- You are being so weird! You could have helped out a little bit more.

# Character: None
~ monologue = false
- Toto continues talking without listening to your remark.

# Character: Toto 
~ monologue = false
- Honestly humans are very similar to our kind from the Andromeda Galaxy. In another galaxy, we could have been friends and co-existed.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false 
- Okay stop that Toto. I wouldn't say we are friends. I am only helping you this one time so I can get out too.

# Character: Toto
~ monologue = false 
- Oh . . . I see.
