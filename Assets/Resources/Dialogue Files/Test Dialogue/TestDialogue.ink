- It's already been months, but I feel like i'm $w(no closer) to figuring any of this out.

- Who am I kidding, i'm not good enough to be on the run and get away with it...
- I should just $w(give up.) 
- I can't even kept a consistent log of events on my computer...

- I feel like the situation has just gotten worse...
- They aren't even trying anymore, the comments don't even match up for most the videos they're associated with.
- Am I $w(shadowbanned?) Or is this just what everyone has to go through with nowadays?
- There's no way for me to really tell anyway... 
- My only hope is to see if I can find signs of a real person that hasn't been blocked off by this $s("system".)
- I'm not super optimistic... but it's all I can do since I don't have anyone that can really help me out right now.
