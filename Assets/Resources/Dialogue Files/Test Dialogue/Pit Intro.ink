- Suddenly you feel a sense of dejavu. Like you have been here before.
- But you have been stuck for a while now in this strange world. 


# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- What is happening to the world? When can I get out?

# Character: Toto
~ monologue = false
- I don't know, but do you understand how long $s(I have been stuck) in this workd?

# Character: None
~ monologue = false
- You start to emphasize Toto's loneliness and think about your own sense of loneliness these past few months.

# Character: Toto
~ monologue = false
- Anyways, it seems like some things are starting to break down. Maybe it's due to code that is corrupted, causing the environment to corrode and black holes to spawn.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- That's great and all but how do I get through now?

# Character: Toto
~ monologue = false
- It looks like those black holes have some $w(gravitational) force but I am sure they are at the end of their life and will collapse on themselves soon.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Well i'll see about that. Time to make them collapse myself, I don't have time for this! Thanks a ton $s(Toto).
