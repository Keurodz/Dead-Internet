- What is happening to the world?

# Character: Toto
~ monologue = false
- It seems like some things are starting to break down. Maybe it's due to many of the packets that get dropped, causing the environment to corrode.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- That's great and all but how do I get through now?

# Character: Toto
~ monologue = false
- It looks like those black holes have a strong $w(gravitational) force but I am sure they are at the end of their life and will collapse on themselves soon.

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Well i'll see about that. Time to make them collapse myself, I don't have time for this! Thanks a ton $s(Toto).
