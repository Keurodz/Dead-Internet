- Hey! You still there?

# Character: None 
~ monologue = false
- Your ears perk up as you hear Toto's voice again. 

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- There you are! I thought $w(I lost you) for a second. It was just radio silence.

# Character: Toto
~ monologue = false
- Haha, I don't know what happened but everything went dark and I lost communication. 

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- I thought you were going to abandon me here for a second. 

# Character: None
~ monologue = false
- You chuckle nervously. You had a feeling that Toto did not intentionally abandon you, but at the same time, you were still unsure if she could be trusted.

# Character: Toto 
~ monologue = false
- Noooo, who do you think I am? I am trying to get out as much as you are. We are in this together.

# Character: None
~ monologue = false
- Pleased with the affirmative response, you begin to gain a spark of motivation. 
- You reply sarcastically.

# Character: Innozen 
~ monologue = false
- Yeah sure you are, stranger little alien I just met online. 

# Character: Toto
~ monologue = false 
- $s(HEYYY!) What did I tell you about calling me little!!
- I might ditch you for real now. 

# Character: Innozen 
~ monologue = false
- No no no! I was just kidding! 

# Character: Toto
~ monologue = false 
- That's right. I'll let it go this time but if you make fun of me again, that will be the end. Anyways, hurry up! You are close to the end now.
