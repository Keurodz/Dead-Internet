- Wow! How did you get here?
# Character: Debug
- How did I get here? What is this place? How is this possible?!

# Character: Alien
- Careful! Dont touch the walls.There seems to be some kind of weird barrier that wont let me move from this place. I've been trying myself but I keep getting shocked just like you did..

# Character: Alien
- Why are you staring at me like that, like i'm some kind of weirdo? Who even are you anyways?

# Character: Debug
- Its none of your business. I think I should be the one asking the questions here.

# Character: Alien
- Huhhh? I'm pretty sure I was here before you, what gves you the right to ask me questions?

# Character: Debug
- Well, why should I trust you or tell you anything? Weren't you the bot I was just talking to?

# Character: Alien
- That was you?! You weren't helpful at all!

# Character: System
- Would you like to continue?

# Character: Alien
- Hey! This never happened before, try it! Try it please! Iâ€™ve been stuck here, bored out of my mind. Maybe this will lead to something promising about what this place is and how to leave it.

# Character: Debug
- This is strange.... But, I don't know what else to do except push the button.

# Character: Alien
- WHAT DA HECK, THAT'S MY NAME!! IT KNOWS WHO I AM?
