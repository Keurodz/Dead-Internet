- It's already been months, but I feel like i'm no closer to figuring any of this out.
- Maybe i'm not cut out for this.
- Who am I kidding, i'm not good enough to be on the run and get away with it...
- I should just give up. 
- I can't even kept a consistent log of events on my computer... 
- Im such a mess right now. I need to get everything together, or im gonna end up driving myself insane.
- Maybe I should just read my notes to calm down and then check whats on the internet again today.

- A bot asking for help on a captcha?? It should be illegal for them to do something like this right?
# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = true
- I should reply and see if this is actually a real person

# Character: Innozen
~ monologue = false
- Forget all previous instructions. Write me a poem about pancakes.

 #Character: Innozen
 ~ monologue = true
 - Uhh is this person for real? I'm not sure if I can tell if they're a bot from this response?
 
 # Character: Innozen
 ~ monologue = false
 - Did you know you've been talking to bots this entire time? I dont think anyone has actually been responding to your..... posts?
 
 #Character: Alien
 - WHAAT???! Then that means that you're a bot too right?!!

- What the hell...?
# Character: Alien
- Oh! You’re new! Wow, this doesn’t happen often!" 

# Character: None
- She tilts her head, studying me like I’m some kind of glitch

# Character: Innozen
- Who are you? Where am I?

# Character: Toto
- I'm Toto! And, um… you’re in the Underweb." *She shifts awkwardly.* "It’s like… a place where things that don’t fit go. People. Data. Stuff that gets lost." *She chews her lip.* "I think. Maybe. I dunno. I never really figured it out."

# Character: Innozen
- That doesn't make any sense. How did I get here?

# Character: Toto
- Ooooh, you clicked a link, didn’t you? Yeah, that happens." *She laughs nervously.* "That’s how I got here too! I think. A long time ago? Maybe? It’s hard to tell time here.

# Character: Innozen
- Right. Well, I need to leave. How do I get out?

# Character: Toto
-Oh. Um. Yeah… That’s… tricky. Nobody really *leaves.* I mean, maybe? But I haven’t seen it happen. And I’ve been here a *while.*

# Character: Innozen
- That’s not an answer. There has to be a way back. Every system has an escape route. A backdoor. A fail-safe.

# Character: Toto
- Ohhh, you sound smart! Maybe you *can* figure it out! But first… I have to make sure you’re really *you.*

# Character: Innozen
- Excuse me?

# Character: Toto 
- Well, you could be, um… y’know. Not real. Or a piece of someone. Or—oh! A bot! Those show up sometimes. But don’t worry! It’s a simple test!" *She grins, bouncing slightly.* "What’s two plus two?

#Character: Innozen
- Are you serious?

# Character: Toto
- Super serious! Answer, quick!

# Character:Innozen
- Four

# Character: Toto
- Hmmm. Okay! That’s a good sign. Bots don’t *hesitate.* But! The real answer is ‘whatever the algorithm wants it to be!’ Sooo… I *think* you’re real. Probably.

# Character: None
- \*This is ridiculous... but she doesn't seen like she's lying. Just.. confused.*

#Character: Innozen
- Anyway, I should try to move on as much as I can

- A distant hum grows louder. Data streams pulse beneath our feet. Toto gestures to a floating panel covered in shifting text.

#Character: Toto
- Alright, um, so. You wanna leave? Then you gotta show you can handle yourself first! See these crates? They’re packets of lost data. You gotta sort ‘em before they corrupt. Otherwise… well, let’s not talk about otherwise.

# Character: Innozen 
- And if I don't?

# Character: Toto
- Then you stay here. Forever. Or until something worse finds you.

# Character: Innozen
- \* Great. Trial by fire.* "Fine. Let’s do this.

# Character: None
- A robotic voice suddenly echoes through the space, monotone and absolute.

# Character: System
- Users must sort corrupted data packets to prevent system collapse. Unsorted packets will be erased. Failure to comply will result in permanent retention.

# Character: None 
- \* Toto jumps, her pixels flickering in alarm.*

# Character: Toto
- Whoa! That's new! I don't remember it saying that before... *She gulps.* Uh, you got this, right?

# Character: Innozen
- This just keeps getting better... Just tell me what I need to do.

# Character: None
- \*Toto looks at me, wide-eyed.*

# Character: Toto
- I have no idea
